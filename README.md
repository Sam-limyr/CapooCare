## Backend

### Running as standalone

1. Open up the PostgreSQL host. Ensure that it is running.
2. Ensure that a .env file exists in the `server` directory, with all the required environment variables as defined in
 `server/keys.js`. This file should never be committed.
3. Navigate to `server` and install all dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`. This should run the backend program as a standalone.
